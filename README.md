**FrontEndDevelopment**
🎓 First-Year University Project – Frontend Web Development

This repository contains my first ever frontend development project, created as part of my university coursework. The project helped me learn and practice the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a fully static website with no backend integration.

📚 Project Overview
The website is structured as a simple multi-page site including:

A homepage (index.html)

About page

Products page

Account page

Support page

Each page is styled using a single CSS file (mystyle.css) and enhanced with basic interactivity through JavaScript (myscript.js).

🌐 Technologies Used
HTML5 – for building the structure and layout of the pages

CSS3 – for styling and responsive design

JavaScript – for basic DOM manipulation and interactivity


📖 What I Learned
Structuring webpages with HTML

Styling elements and layout with CSS

Adding simple JavaScript for interactivity (like form validation, toggling menus, etc.)

Organising assets like images, videos, and audio into folders

Basic principles of user interface design
